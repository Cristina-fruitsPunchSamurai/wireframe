# üçî Recipes website üç™ - wireframe design

This is a website collecting recipes. For this MVP, I worked on the responsive web design.

The objective of this project was to learn how to design a wireframe desktop, mobile and tablet.But first of all I had to define the **user stories**.

The fake client expected these features :

- **Top of the page :**
  - A logo must be displayed (when clicking on this logo, we go back to the home page)
  - The navigation menu must allow the navigation through home, recipes, starters, main courses, desserts.

- **Home page :**

  - At the top of the page we have to display a paragraph (this paragraph will change each week )
  - There should be a link to a random recipe, each time we refresh a new recipe is displayed.
  - Display a lsit of 5 most recent recipes
  - Display a list of 5 best rated recipes

- **Footer :**

  - Link to contact page, legal information, a form allowing to submit a new recipe, a summary of the website, useful for the SEO.

- **On a recipe page :**

  - We should seee the list of ingredients but separately from the rest of the recipe
  - The steps of the recipe should be listed by order (number)

For the conception of this project I used : [Whimsical.com](https://whimsical.com/)
